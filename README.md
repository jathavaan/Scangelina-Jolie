# Scangelina Jolie v2

This is a project for the course TBA4256 3D Digital modelling at NTNU. The program classifies bulidings, trees, terrain and rivers in an aerial LiDAR scan of Trondheim. There are two types of notebooks: 1.x and 2.x. The 1.x notebooks are used to run the actual detection script and needs to be run in ascending order. The 2.x notebooks are scripts created to extract data for the final report.  

To install the requirements simply run the following command in the terminal:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
